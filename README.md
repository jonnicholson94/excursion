# excursion

As part of Codecademy's full-stack engineer path, I was tasked with putting together a very basic HTML/CSS website, before hosting on GitHub pages.

This is based upon their mock-up / redline linked [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion_redline.png).

It required:

- Very simple CSS
- Usage of headers / footers in HTML
- Implementation of video and images
- Basic Git version control
- Hosting on GitHub pages
